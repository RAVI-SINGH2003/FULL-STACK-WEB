    <h1>About iife (Immediately invoked function expression)</h1>
    <p>An iife is a javascript function that runs as soo as it is defined</p>
    <p>It is a design pattern which is also known as self executing anonymous function and contains two major parts</p>
    <p>The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping operator (). This prevents
        accessing variables within IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope</p>
    <p>The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression() through which the javascript engine will
        directly interpret the function</p>

    <script>
        // example of iife
        //author has e=become private now
        // (function () {
        //     var author = "Ravi";
        //     console.log('Author name is '+ author);
        // })();
        //author not defined
        // console.log(author)

        //example 2 of iife 
        (function (author) {

            console.log('Author name is '+ author);
        })("Ravi");
